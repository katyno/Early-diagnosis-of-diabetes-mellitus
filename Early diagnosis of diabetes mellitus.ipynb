{"cells": [{"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Early diagnosis of diabetes mellitus"}, {"metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "November 14, 1991 was proclaimed Diabetes Day to commemorate the fundamental work that has been and is being done around the world to close the gaps in public understanding of the disease. This date was chosen as a sign of respect and memory to the great scientist Frederick Bunting, who was born in 1891 on this day in 1891.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases in the world. The disease is dangerous, first of all, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, leading to the development of complications affecting all the most important organs and systems of the body.  \n\nThe peculiarity of this disease is that external signs may not appear for several years after the onset of development. This leads to the fact that the pathology has time to cause significant harm to the body before treatment is started. Therefore, early diagnosis of diabetes is so important. \n\nBut, in many countries, people do not have the opportunity to undergo laboratory blood tests and therefore remain without treatment. Can we diagnose diabetes with a high degree of probability for a number of signs without doing laboratory blood tests? This notebook is designed to answer this question through data analysis. \n\nCase Data is provided by [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.)\n\n![alt-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katyno/Early-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus/main/diabetes.jpg \"diabetes\")\n\nSince our question requires an answer - is the patient sick or not (yes / no), then in this case it is possible to use a classification approach based on the feature description. In this study, the attributes characterize the symptoms of diabetes mellitus and are binary (except for age), namely:\n\nAttribute|---|---\n:---|:---|:---\nAge|1. 20-65\nSex|1.
